# CMSI-186-Programming-Lab

## Apprenticeship-styled workshop loosely structured around the notion of algorithm paradigms, displayed in medium-sized application. Typical projects include discrete simulation, randomized estimation, maze solving, dynamic programming, large-number arithmetic, and numerical methods.

### Projects coded in Java

#### Area Estimator
Used 1 million points to estimate the area under the curve as well as the area of a shape in a plane.  

#### Change Maker
Dynamic programming implementation. Determine the minimum amount of coins of various denominations needed to fulfill change of any value.

#### Big Integer
Re-creation of the Java BigInteger class.

#### Clock Solver
Utilizes the Clock class to determine the times in which the hour and minutes hand land at specific angle.  
Inputs:  
Slice: The increments of the clock measured.  
Angle: Must be between 0 and 360.

#### Date Distance
Distance between two dates

#### Map Colorer
Colors map so that none of the bordering sections are the same.
